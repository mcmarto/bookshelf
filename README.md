# Bookshelf
Sample project to help with learning Spring Boot.

The initial commit is just a simple Spring Boot project with no additional dependencies on the classpath.

## Build and Run
To build

    ./mvnw clean verify

To run your application

    ./mvnw spring-boot:run

Or, alternatively

    java -jar target/bookshelf-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The initial project doesn't do anything so it will run and terminate straight away.

## Environment
* Spring Boot - 2.1.9.RELEASE
* Build Tool - Maven
